1.  Explain a subquery in your own words.

    A subquery is a query within another query that enables you to get more specific results.

2.  Where can you use a subquery within a SELECT statement?

    While subqueries are most often found in the `WHERE` clause, they can also be placed in the `FROM` and  `SELECT` clauses.

3.  When would you employ a subquery?

    Subqueries are good for when there are multiple pieces of logic required to retrieve your data. Subqueries are often easier to read than a Join statement is. They also eliminate data duplication that can happen with a Join.

4.  Explain a row constructor in your own words.

    A row constructor goes inside the WHERE clause to compare data against each row and it evaluates to either `true`, `false`, or `null`.

5.  What happens if a row in the subquery result provides a NULL value to the comparison?

    `Null` is the value returned to the primary query for that specific row.

6.  What are the ways to use a subquery within a WHERE clause?

    Row constructor, Exists, In, Not In, All, Any, Some, Not Exists.

9. Using this Library schema and data, write queries applying the following scenarios:

    A)  To determine if the library should buy more copies of a given book, please provide the names and position, in order, of all of the patrons with a hold (request for a book with all copies checked out) on "Advanced Potion-Making".

    http://sqlfiddle.com/#!17/62f88/605

    B)  Make a list of all book titles and denote whether or not a copy of that book is checked out.

    http://sqlfiddle.com/#!17/62f88/638

    C)  In an effort to learn which books take longer to read, the librarians would like you to create a list of total checked out time by book name in the past month.

    http://sqlfiddle.com/#!17/62f88/669

    D)  In order to learn which items should be retired, make a list of all books that have not been checked out in the past 5 years.

    http://sqlfiddle.com/#!17/62f88/712

    E)  List all of the library patrons. If they have one or more books checked out, correspond the books to the patrons.

10. Using this Flight schema and data, write queries applying the following scenarios:

    A)  To determine the most profitable airplanes, find all airplane models where each flight has had over 250 paying customers in the past month.

    http://sqlfiddle.com/#!17/41482/87

    B)  To determine the most profitable flights, find all destination-origin pairs where 90% or more of the seats have been sold in the past month.

    http://sqlfiddle.com/#!17/41482/101

    C)  The airline is looking to expand its presence in Asia and globally. Find the total revenue of any flight (not time restricted) arriving at or departing from Singapore (SIN).

11. Compare the subqueries you've written above. Compare them to the joins you wrote in Checkpoint 6. Which ones are more readable? Which were more logical to write?

    After I finally understood the concept of subqueries, they're both more readable and more logical to write. No need to think about the join or how it would work, which info will or will not be included. You have much more granular access to data.

    You write the smaller query, then, once you have that working, write the larger one to access the data required.
